My name is Ruan Lucena Ramos and I have gathered my projects and Web Templates to show you in this repository

The purpose of this repository is to show some projects and templates developed by me as a student of Systems Analysis and Development

Still, these projects and templates were developed using Front End technologies


### **The projects have**:
- Name
- Info

- How to View
- Image
- Figma Template (if any)
- Link

**Design driven**

This was my first web landing page developed using ReactJS, it served to further my studies with this library, however I did not manage to finalize it nor to give it functionalities other than its own look

**Development Stack**
- ReactJS with Typescript
- Html, CSS

## Landing Page 2

**Link Shortcut**

This template was developed using ReactJS with Typescript and some React libraries like Lib React-Icons, this project has the objective of being a link shortener, but I didn't direct the links to the correct pages, but I didn't do it 100% , that is, I did not direct the links..

**Development Stack**
- ReactJS with Typescript
- Html, CSS
- React Icons
- Styled Components
- Hover CSS Lib
